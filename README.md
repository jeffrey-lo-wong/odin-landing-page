# odin-landing-page
Pre-Project:
This is my second project following my journey as a full-stack developer. I will be honest that I am very unsure about my skills despite going through practice problems that were provided for me in CSS. Nevertheless, I will pursue this project as a challenge and a lesson. In this project, I will be constructing the landing page of a website. By finishing this project I will demonstrate my knowledge of flexbox's, the basics of HTML and CSS, and my potential as a front-end developer. 

Post-Project:
This project has demonstrated my skills as a beginner in web development. I have showcased my knowledge in the box model, flex box's, HTML elements, and CSS styling. This project was by no means difficult in the design. However, there was much difficulty and frustration when it came to learning and experiencing the difficulties with flex box's. I have learned so much from this project and it has really pushed me to discover new things about the web and its components.
